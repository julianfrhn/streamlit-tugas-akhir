12,,,James C,L,3,"Good place to eat noodles, especially chinese noodle (Yamien). Wide variety of noodles provided with various side dish such as wonton soup, siomay, meatball, etc. Clean and wide bathroom makes us comfortable to use it. Unfortunately there is so many customers, hence it feels little bit crowded. Parking space is not that wide and maybe only consist of 5-6 cars"
13,,,Meisya Nabilla Puspita,P,5,yesterday i tried mie yamin asin because it was a rainy day and the taste is really good! u should try these too!🤍
14,,,Hendra wiraatmaja,L,4,"Very crowded resto if you lunch here, the place is small, but worth to wait, it have best yamien in town. Taste is delicious.. try it and you will come back again.."
15,,,Felicia Catlin ,P,3,It's really good!! The place is a bit shabby and all but the taste is just top notch. My favorite is 'yamien manis' as it tastes really rich for me!!

20,,,Wuri Woori,P,4,Tempatnya agak kecil.
21,Bakmie Karet,Jl. Natuna No. 9,Rayza,L,3,"The food was amazing but the service was a big no no. The waitress had a great convo with another staffs loudly. We had to wait sooooo long for a bottle of sarsaparila, it came after our noodle almost finished. We also found insects inside our cups of teas."
22,,,Agus Wiwanto,L,2,"Actually I do not really want to come because I do not really like thick noodles but they provide the thin noodles too. Tastewise, the noodles, the pangsit basah (dumpling) and the baso goreng (fried meat ball) are above the average but I prefer pangsit goreng (fried dumpling) from more famous noodle chains. Their yamien asin (salty) is better than their yamien manis (sweet). I think it is because I do not really like their choice of kecap manis (indonesia sweet soya sauce)."
23,,,Julia Daniel,P,3,"I usually ate Bakmie Karet at jl cibadak, this is the first time i eat at jl natuna, the taste as good as always."
24,,,Petrus Edi,L,4,Pork and no pork noodle. Nice to try.

32,,,Welldone ID,L,4,"Pertama kali ke sini nyobain pangsit oseng rebus. Rasanya enak, saya lebih suka kulit pangsitnya daripada isiannya yang menurut saya rasanya kurang nge-blend dengan bumbu osengnya."

37,,,Adira Damai,L,4,"Decent place to eat. For me, the yamin itself is average. But their chili oil is worth mentioning. Don't forget to add it because it will improve the taste significantly. It is not recommended to go there with a car though."
38,,,Meida Atida,P,5,"worth the hype! the noodle has good texture, however loaded with a lot of oils underneath the toppings, and i requested to add more veggies on top, baso goreng was pretty crunch & kuah on beside as neutralize all of them! love it love it 9/10 overall!"
39,,,Fernaldi,L,1,Not recommended in holiday season. I try to dine in but must wait in line for 15 people. We wait until 1 people left within 1.5 hour but we asked to wait again for 30 min because the chicken was run low and being cooked.

The soup is good, porky & I suggest you add lots of pepper for better cold day remedy. The offal are all good, clean, fresh, no funny smell. Price point is acceptable, just right. Several payment options available. I paid with Gopay because there was a cashback. Definitely a must visit when in Bandung"

136,Bakmie Pollo,Jl. Jend. Sudirman No.247,Yulien,L,4,Tempatnya strategis dan bersih. Harganya cukup terjangkau. Rasa makanannya perlu ditingkatkan kembali karena masih agak keasinan menurutku (yamien asin) dan berminyak. Pemiliknya ramah dan mau mendengarkan saran dan masukan.

159,,,Sheila A,P,4,"Easily found the place with gmaps, not too far from a well-known bed & breakfast in the area. Misua kuah tastes really great; not too soggy yet still chewy, best served hot. Bakso goreng is a mandatory to try! You can always rely on a noodle place that sell bakso goreng. This humble shop lets u unwind in a very serene area, though it’s close at 6pm."
160,,,Willie OM,L,5,"Mie is ok, pangsit is superb. 👍👌 …"
161,Gentha Bakmie Medan,Jl. Senam VI No.2,Kemanamanamakan,L,3,"Love their panggang menu. One of the best Babi panggang karo in Bandung. Went here after a long time, and they still serve the same. You can order many other menu such as bihun goreng, kwetiau, ikan mas, saksang and many more. The place is quite hidden because no signage upfront, but the place gets busy at lunch hour. Definetely comeback to try another menu. 🥰"

167,,,Reza Fauzi,L,3,"Hari Minggu yang syahdu, udah lama ga ke bakmie syukur ini Disambut dengan koko yang ramah, harga bakmie rica yg affordable seporsi besar cuma 20rb, bisa pesan setengah juga kokk, dan pangsit rebus 5 buah cuma 10rb 😍😍😍 sangat disarankan buat yg senang hunting bakmie di Bandung"
168,,,Buitenzorg Marini,P,4,"Rasa bakmi lumayan, sayang tunggunya agak lama, karena yang buat mie, cuci piring dan terima bayaran hanya engkonya sendirian. Dan menu mie ayam merah juga dudah tidak ada."

171,Mie Akong,Jl. Pungkur No.58,Lei,P,5,Probably the best noodle in the city. They've been making noodles for more than 2 decades. Still the best for me. Last I went there the price is around 50 K for a bowl including the soup. You can feel the richness coming from the pork fat. Should one of you is a noodle addict. Definitely try this one. 
172,,,Tactical Note,P,1,"This noodle eating house serve non halal dishes, old style taste, very nice, price expensive, the place not so clean"
173,,,Edwin Petrus,L,5,The noodle tasted very well with combination of a portion of soup (you may choose either dumpling or pork internal organs). You may choose also salty or sweet tasted of noodle. They also serve cooked Chinese food menus. This noodle house has opened for such a long time. Pricing is quite moderate. Parking is at the roadside. Payment can only be made by cash. You may also order by online food delivery apps
174,,,Dewi Subagyo,P,4,"One of traditional Chinese restaurant in Bandung. The atmosphere is so.. traditional. So ""indonesian-chinese"", ehehehehe.. What I like most? The yamien (noodle) and pangsit (dumplings). Beautiful! They also offered meatballs and offals. The price is quite expensive I think, noodle about 30s K rupiahs (exclude dumplings). Parking lots are limited, especially for cars."
175,,,Yohanes Luka,L,3,Classic chinese noodle with pork. With a Bangka Island style. My favorite place to eat noodle with babat (cow tripe). This place is a legend ! Nice 👍👍 …

Cobain deh kalo lewat kesini 😆 *harga sudah termasuk ppn"
182,,,Ericko Tandayu,L,5,The fried rice is DELICIOUS! Bakmi Jowo is normal. It's open at 5 o'clock in the evening.. you have to wear a jacket so you don't get cold.
183,,,Nanna Heri,P,3,"Mantap rasanya ... Harga gak nguras dompet... Tersedia pilihan mie, kwetiauw goreng atau rebus..."

191,Bakmie Afang,Jl. Pasir kaliki No.71B,Stephen Chandra,L,5,"The fall to place for a decent bowl of Bakmi ayam! Go for the mie lebar( wide noodles) and have them cooked extra hard( kurang dari setengah matang) and dont forget to accompany your sumptuous bowl of noodles with a side order of their Yam Pangsit( DO order the 10 piece order not the 5 as you definitely wont have enough of it! Comes with a choice of salty or sweet, both are equally good but the sweet version is unique, best of all, why not order both versions?) Centrally located ( not too far from the main train station of Bandung) and easy to spot on the left side of the street heading towards Istana Plaza, you wont miss it!"
192,,,Suria Nata,L,4,"First time here but we love the noodles. We enjoyed the fried meatballs, wontons, meatballs to go with the thin noodles. Delicious. Easy to get there as it’s on the way to the toll-road to Jakarta."
193,,,M,P,3,"Clean and cozy place, delicious noodles, affordable price. Though the place is quite small for groups and a bit noisy cause its located on busy road. I think its home made noodles since it taste quite different from some noodles i've been eating. They accept various payment methods such as ovo and gopay which is a plus."
194,,,Heng Dju Ong,L,4,"Small thin noodles, pretty standard, place is clean, service is quick almost faster than western fast food even."
195,,,Glen Main-Main,L,5,"This is one of a good place (clean and cozy restaurant) that serves noodle. The location of this place is strategic (adjacent to Bandung Railway Station and Istana Plaza), but the place is a little bit small, so you must pay attention when you want to go to this place. The noodle is delicious, and I think this is one of best noodle in Bandung. There are no vegetables served in this place, except leeks."

It used to be a very tasty, delicious, mouth watering experience whenever I visited the restaurant chains. They used to serve salt, salty ketchup, pepper, chilli, in every table to cater to people who like tasty and spicy food. ... Not anymore! ... You just have to follow their taste: Singaporean taste with no salt, no sugar, no spice. ... I would think twice before entering this restaurant again."
